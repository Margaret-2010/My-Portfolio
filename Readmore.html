    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a highly motivated and passionate student at Veritas University, Abuja, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My journey in the tech world began with curiosity and has since grown into a full-fledged passion for software development and digital design. Over the years, I have honed my skills as a Full Stack Programmer and a UI/UX Designer, combining technical expertise with a creative mindset to build high-quality, user-centered applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a full stack developer, I have experience working with both front-end and back-end technologies. On the front-end, I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, building clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces. On the back-end, I have worked with Node.js, Express, and database technologies such as MongoDB and MySQL to create robust APIs and data-driven applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to programming, I am equally passionate about UI/UX design. I believe that good design is just as important as strong functionality. Using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Canva, I craft user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces that improve usability and overall user experience. I pay close attention to layout, color theory, typography, and user behavior to ensure every project is both beautiful and practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have developed a variety of real-world projects including task management apps, e-commerce websites, blog platforms, and weather applications. These projects not only demonstrate my proficiency in multiple programming languages and frameworks but also showcase my ability to solve problems, work independently, and deliver high-quality solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond technical skills, I’m also a fast learner, an excellent communicator, and a strong team player. I enjoy working collaboratively on group projects and contributing to open-source communities. I continuously seek new challenges that push me to grow, explore emerging technologies, and refine my development and design abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who builds innovative digital products that make a difference. Whether I’m coding, designing, or brainstorming new ideas, I’m always driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to excellence.
